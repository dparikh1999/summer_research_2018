# Returning to Github

---
# This is what we will primarily use 

--
### What is the purpose?  

To share, edit, save and make reproducible work!

--
### How does it work?  

**Fork** (copying) -&gt; **clone** (downloading) -&gt; **edit** (workflow) -&gt; **commit** (edits you made)/**push** (pushing them to the master repo) -&gt; **pull request**

&lt;/div&gt;

---
# Forking
- A repo is the data science equivalent of copying a repo from another GitHub user (using    Github website). 
- Note, this does not actually download anything on to your computer, but rather it adds     the forked repo to your list of repos in your account.

# Cloning

---
# Cloning


--
**What does it mean?** downloads a repo to your desktop
- Choose where you want to clone it on your hard drive 
- NOTE think about where you want to clone something before you do it… moving it later is a pain), and, finally, click the _Clone_ button

# Committing pushing

---
# Committing and pushing


--
**What does it mean?** Whenever you make significant changes to your project you need to commit them. 
- You can think of this as putting the relevant changes you made in a waiting room. You can then decide when to incorporate the changes 
- It does not have to be right away 
- The changes only exist on your system clone of the repo. Nobody else can see them, nor use them. 

---
# Committing and Pushing Continued
--

- _ALWAYS CHECK CHANGES BEFORE COMMITTING AND PUSHING THEM - MAKE SURE TO PUSH THEM TO YOUR REPO_
- In order to share your changes with others you need to commit the changes to your repo and push them to GitHub (online).
- It is a good idea to review your changes at this point to make sure that you did what you think you did.   

--  



- Next write a brief description of the changes you made where it says Summary.  
- The summary should remind future you what you did 3 months from now (in case you have to revert back to an old version of the repo). 
- Afterwards click Commit to master 
- Click the Push origin button 
- Now go back to your account on GitHub.com and look at the repo. 
  Notice that your changes have been incorporated to your version of the repo

# Submittig a pull request

# Submitting a pull request


--
**Submitting a pull request:** submit a pull request so that those changes can be merged with the master repo (i.e. anarinzler/summer_research_2018).
- From your summer_research_2018 repo on the GitHub website (yourname/summer_research_2018) click the **New pull** request button.
- Please check and make sure that your pull request affects only your dropbox.
- This shows that you are requesting to merge from your version of the repo to the original version. 

--
- Second, notice that the information we provided in our commit and push to the web is automatically used as the subject of the pull request (red arrow). If necessary, you can add more information here. Finally, click the Create pull request button to submit the pull request

# Fetching Changes
---

# Fetching Changes
**What is the purpose?:** getting the most update to date version of the repo…
Fetch the most recent changes to the repo from my master version to your local copy. 

- From the GitHub Desktop app, click Repository &gt; Repository settings....
- You will see the address of your cloned copy of the repo on the GitHub website. 
- We will change this address to the version of the repo we want to fetch changes from. 
- In this case, we want the direction of my version of the repo, so we change the username  to  (https://github.com/anarizler/summer_research_2018.git), click Save.

---
# Fetching Continued

- Click the Fetch origin button 
- Click Pull origin: The application will check and see if your local copy is different from the origin. 
- This means that if we click the button again, we will pull the changes from the origin to our local copy. 
- There is one more thing you need to do and this is important so pay attention... 

--
**Make sure you point your origin back to your GitHub repo after you have fetched any changes. This means you need to do steps 1 and 2 again, but change from https://github.com/anarinzler/summer_research_2018.git to https://github.com/yourname/summer_research_2018.git**

# Final Notes on Github

README.md are automatically converted to HTML and displayed in the repo page. 
- It is always a good idea to include READMEs in your projects. You can use them to explain the details of your project 
- Both for future you and other people who may fork it

---
# SPSS

We will be using lab computers that already have SPSS on them 
- No need to download
- Will be learning about ANOVA

---
# Last comments

### Sakai
- Will create a site for us there as well
